# Multi-Agent Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Multi-Agent Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Reinforcement Learning project! This project combines an interactive Pygame-based environment with a Q-learning reinforcement learning model to enable agents to learn optimal strategies in the classic game.

## Files

- multi_agent_rps_env.py: This python script file contains the code for the game environment using Pygame.
- main.py: This python script file contains the code for the reinforcement learning model code based on Q-learning.
- Images: This folder contains the images required for the game.
- bg_song.mp3: This mp3 file contains the background song for the game.


## Usage

1. Run the environment:python multi_agent_rps_env.py
   
2. Train the reinforcement learning model:python main.py
   
3. Explore the game and training results through the Pygame interface and plotted graphs.

## Note:
- Install all the require modules before running the code.

- Edit the image and background song file paths before running environment.
